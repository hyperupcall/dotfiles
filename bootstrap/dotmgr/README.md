# dotmgr

dotmgr is a collection of utilities I use for dotfile boostraping and general system maintenance. These files could be a [Basalt](https://github.com/hyperupcall/basalt) package, but I've opted not to do that for simplicity and reliability

This was originally procured in [hyperupcall/dots-bootstrap](https://github.com/hyperupcall/dots-bootstrap), but has sinced moved here for easier maintenance

Components from [hyperupcall/dotshellextract](https://github.com/hyperupcall/dotshellextract) and [dotshellgen](https://github.com/hyperupcall/dotshellgen) have also been merged with dotmgr
